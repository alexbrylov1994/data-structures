// 277. Find the Celebrity

// Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1), and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her, but he/she does not know any of them.

// Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

// You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n). There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

// Example 1:

// Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
// Example 2:


// Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: There is no celebrity.

// Imagine people lined up and you ask from the first person c whether he/she knows i person, two situations are going to happen:
// - he/she doesn't, this means, c person has the potential to become the celebrity while i person does not, we move on
// - If he/she does, this automatically mark him/her as unqualified and we can mark i person as our new c, 
// and the people in between automatically disqualified. Why? because in order to become a celebrity, everybody has to know you. 
// and because of the set up, between c & i at least one person doesnt know him/her.
