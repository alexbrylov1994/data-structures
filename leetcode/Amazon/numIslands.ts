// 200. Number of Islands

// Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

// An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

// Example 1:

// Input: grid = [
//   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
//   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
//   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
// ]
// Output: 1
// Example 2:

// Input: grid = [
//   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
//   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
//   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
// ]
// Output: 3

// Time complexity : O(MÃ—N) where MM is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.

// Space complexity : O(min(M,N)) because in worst case where the grid is filled with lands, the size of queue can grow up to min(M,N).
